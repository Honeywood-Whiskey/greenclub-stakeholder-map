# 🌿 Mission

The **GreenClub Stakeholder Map** is a community-driven initiative by Cornell GreenClub to centralize, visualize, and strengthen the network of sustainability partners across Cornell and the Ithaca area.

## 🎯 Our Purpose

Each semester, GreenClub members engage with dozens of external partners — restaurants, composting sites, nonprofits, and student organizations — but institutional memory is easily lost as members graduate.  
Our goal is to **create a living, transparent ecosystem** that ensures every outreach effort, partnership, and contact is preserved for future sustainability projects.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Accessibility** — Information should be easy to find, maintain, and update.  
2. **Transparency** — Data shared within the Cornell community remains open and verifiable.  
3. **Collaboration** — The platform encourages cross-project synergy among student teams and local partners.  
4. **Continuity** — The system persists across semesters and leadership changes.  
5. **Impact over Scale** — Focus on meaningful connections, not just quantity of data.

## 🪴 Why This Matters

> “Community sustainability depends on continuity — this project builds that foundation.”

By maintaining a shared data layer between members and map users, GreenClub ensures that each semester’s efforts build upon the last, forming an enduring knowledge base that reflects Ithaca’s evolving sustainability ecosystem.
