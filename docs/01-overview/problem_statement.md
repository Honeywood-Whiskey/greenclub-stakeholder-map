# ⚠️ Problem Statement

### 🧩 The Challenge

Cornell GreenClub works with dozens of sustainability partners each semester — from composting facilities and restaurants to local nonprofits and student organizations.  
However, every academic year, project data, partner information, and outreach history are **lost or fragmented** as leadership transitions occur.

This leads to:
- Duplicate outreach to the same organizations.  
- Missed collaboration opportunities between student teams.  
- Inconsistent reporting of impact metrics.  
- Time wasted re-collecting information that already exists.  

> In short: the club’s **institutional knowledge resets every semester**.

### 🗂️ The Core Data Problem

| Issue | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scattered Contacts** | Partner information exists in personal spreadsheets or emails, inaccessible to new members. |
| **Non-standardized Tracking** | Different teams record data differently (Google Sheets, Docs, etc.). |
| **No Central Map or Database** | No visual overview of who GreenClub partners with, where they are located, or what initiatives they support. |
| **Manual Updates** | Members spend hours reformatting data for reports instead of acting on it. |

---

### 🌍 The Broader Context

This is not just a GreenClub problem — it reflects a **wider challenge in student sustainability projects**:
- Short project cycles  
- Limited knowledge transfer  
- Poor integration across campus organizations  

Without a central platform, collaboration remains siloed and reactive.

### 💡 Why the Stakeholder Map Solves This

The **GreenClub Stakeholder Map** introduces a durable, transparent data system that:
1. Centralizes all partner information into one Airtable base.  
2. Automatically syncs to a live map, making sustainability networks visible.  
3. Documents partner relationships for future semesters.  
4. Encourages continuous collaboration and outreach growth.

This transforms partner management from a **semesterly scramble** into a **long-term ecosystem** — preserving institutional memory while inviting innovation.

### 📍 Summary

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|-----------|
| Lost contact and project history | Centralized Airtable CRM |
| No visual coordination between partners | Mapbox-powered visualization |
| Manual, disorganized updates | Automated sync scripts |
| Limited continuity after leadership turnover | Open-source documentation and data model |

> **In essence:** GreenClub’s stakeholder map doesn’t just solve an internal pain point — it lays the foundation for sustainable continuity across Cornell’s entire environmental ecosystem.
